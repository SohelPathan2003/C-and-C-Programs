        what are the drawback of structure:
         there are several drawback of structure.
         1st data security is the major drawback of  structure means c doesn't provide 
         any access specifier to hide the data.
         2nd we cannot used method or fuction in structure...
         3rd  many drawback they and java has overcomes those drawback.
         4th  there are four important pillar's in java

         name as .
               polymorphism :
                what is polymorphism?
                polymorphism means single entity having many form.or we can say same thing
                changes it's behaviour according to the situation in know as polymorphism.

                what are the benefit of polymorphism?
                with the of polymorphism we can achieve run time polymorphism or compiler time 
                polymorphism.

                how we can achieve run time polymorphism or compile time polymorphism.
                we achieve compile time polymorphism with help of method overloading 
                whereas run time polymorphism we can achieve through the method overriding.


                what is method overloading?
                method overloading means we create two function with same name but different 
                parameter or sequence of parameter.

                what are the benefit of method overloading ?
                the major benefit of method overloading is to not remembering the function name
                or no need to remember function name just pass there argument to function definition
                

                scenario:
                       suppose we have to create application for college management system.
                       where we have to declare or use huge method , we have to define 
                       lots of function 

                


               abstraction
               encapsulation
               inheritance
